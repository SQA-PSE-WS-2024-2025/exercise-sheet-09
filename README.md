# About
This repository contains the classes needed for solving PSE WS 22/23 excercise sheet 9.

The sheet has a presence and a homework part.

In the presence part you will work with collections, use overloading and overriding and write recursive operations.
In the homework part you will learn the concepts of object-oriented programming.

The code should be solved in the specific classes.
In the presence part you have to use the classes in this project and in the homework part you have to create your own maven project.
You don't need this repo for the homework part.
